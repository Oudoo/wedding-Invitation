# AgentOS

> A governance framework for multi-agent AI development. Provides branching strategy, worktree isolation, commit standards, and structured handoff protocols for Claude Code, Antigravity, and other AI coding agents.

## What This Is

AgentOS is a **template repository** that establishes a shared "operating system" of rules that AI agents follow when collaborating on a codebase. It solves the coordination problem:

- **Branching protection** — Agents never touch `main` directly
- **Clean branch names** — No random strings, IDs, or hashes appended
- **Worktree isolation** — Multiple agents code simultaneously in separate directories
- **Sync-before-start** — Agents always pull latest before coding
- **Structured handoffs** — A machine-readable `.agent/HANDOFF.md` template prevents context loss between sessions
- **Agent-specific proxies** — Each agent reads its own config file that routes to the master `.agent/AGENTS.md`

## Quick Start

### New Project (from template)

```bash
new my-app
```

### Retrofit an Existing Project

```bash
cd ~/Work/Tech/my-existing-project
agent-os
```

### Create an Isolated Worktree for an Agent

```bash
worktree feat/add-login
cd .worktrees/feat/add-login
# Start Claude Code or Antigravity inside this folder
```

### Start a Subproject Branch

```bash
branch feat/auth-service
# Creates branch, scaffolds feat/auth-service/.agent/HANDOFF.md, auto-commits
```

### Manual Setup

1. Use this template on GitHub → "Use this template" → "Create a new repository"
2. Clone your new repo locally
3. Start coding with any AI agent — they'll read the governance files automatically

Then run `source ~/.zshrc` to activate.

## How It Works

1. **Initialize Repo** → `new my-project` or `agent-os`
2. **Proxy routes to `.agent/AGENTS.md`** → agent learns the governance rules
3. **Agent creates a feature branch** → never touches `main`
4. **Agent codes, commits, pushes** → preserves state on remote
5. **Agent concludes** → fills `.agent/HANDOFF.md` with structured handoff state
6. **Next agent reads `.agent/HANDOFF.md`** → resumes instantly without re-analyzing the entire codebase

## Worktree Isolation (Multi-Agent Concurrency)

By default, Git swaps files inside a single folder. With `git worktree`, you create a **separate physical folder** for each branch. This lets multiple agents code simultaneously without collisions.

### Setup

```bash
# One-time: .gitignore already excludes .worktrees/ via this template
mkdir -p .worktrees
```

### Create a worktree

```bash
worktree feat/add-login
# Or manually:
git worktree add .worktrees/feat/add-login -b feat/add-login
```

### Use with agents

1. `cd .worktrees/feat/add-login`
2. Start Claude Code or Antigravity **inside that folder**
3. The agent codes in complete filesystem isolation
4. Commits inside the worktree are instantly recognized by the main repo

### Clean up after merge

```bash
git worktree remove .worktrees/feat/add-login
```

### Why Worktrees?

- **Antigravity codes in Folder A** while **Claude debugs in Folder B** — zero file conflicts
- Both share the same `.git` history in the background
- No need to push to GitHub to sync locally between worktrees
- Each agent can run its own dev server on a different port

## The Master AgentOS Matrix

| Scenario | Command to Type | What It Actually Does | Impact on Tokens & Workflow |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Start a completely new project container** | `new centro-aeo-geo` | Clones your GitHub template, sets up a private repo, and changes directories into it. | **Saves 5-10 minutes of manual configuration.** Zero token impact yet. |
| **Add AgentOS rules to an existing app** | `agent-os` | Downloads rules, hooks proxies, and safely appends to your `.gitignore`. | **Stops agent amnesia.** Future incoming agents instantly understand boundaries. |
| **Isolate work to a separate folder** | `worktree feat/login` | Spawns a physical directory at `.worktrees/feat/login` tied to that branch. | **Enables parallel coding.** Multiple agents can code at the exact same time without file or server conflicts. |
| **Start a clean subproject workspace** | `branch aeo-service` | Creates a branch, builds a dedicated folder, seeds a local `.agent/HANDOFF.md`, and auto-commits. | **Zero random numbers in branch names.** Keeps multi-app repos perfectly organized. |
| **Before launching any agent sequence** | `map` | Builds a compressed architectural text tree at `.agent/repo-map.md`. | **Saves up to 40% on discovery tokens.** Stops agents from blindly reading every file to understand structure. |
| **An agent hits a token wall or you switch tools** | *Promoted prompt inside agent chat* | Agent populates the detailed `.agent/HANDOFF.md` template, commits, and pushes. | **Context retention is 100%.** Incoming agent picks up exactly where the last one stopped. |
| **You need a fast session pause without a full handoff** | `checkpoint "debugging auth"` | Records uncommitted work with a fast git snapshot and drops a 1-line timestamped note into `.agent/HANDOFF.md`. | **Saves context on a time crunch.** Prevents losing local state when switching mental tracks quickly. |
| **You resume an interrupted session** | `resume` | Parses the state file and prints the GOAL, BLOCKER, and NEXT_STEP to the terminal. | **Instant mental context restoration.** You and your agent know exactly what to do next. |
| **You need to verify the environment** | `doctor` | Runs a health check on the repository for AgentOS compliance. | **Catches structural errors early.** Ensures the handoff files and remote targets exist. |

## Complete End-to-End Workflow Map

1. **Morning Routine (The Scaffold):** Run `new <name>` or navigate to your project and run `branch <name>`. Run `map` once immediately before opening your agent code editor.
2. **The Active Coding Cycle:** Give your prompt to Claude Code or Antigravity inside your branch or worktree folder. They read the map, find their files surgically, and write code.
3. **The Micro-Pause:** If you need to step away or jump to another task unexpectedly, drop a `checkpoint "fixing endpoint layout"` in your terminal.
4. **The Pivot Handoff:** When an agent runs low on tokens or hits a complex wall, use the structured prompt to force a `.agent/HANDOFF.md` generation, push to GitHub, and open your second agent using the clean instructions. Or, run `resume` to recall where you were.
