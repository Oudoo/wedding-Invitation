You are bound by the global AgentOS governance model. 

Before processing any requests or analyzing the directory, you MUST first read the master ruleset located at `.agent/AGENTS.md`.

Obey the branching, isolation, and commit protocols strictly.

1. Read `.agent/AGENTS.md` for global rules — it is the single source of truth.
2. Run `git fetch origin && git pull --rebase origin $(git branch --show-current)` before starting any task.
3. Work strictly on feature branches. NEVER commit to `main`.
4. Stage, commit, and push using `git push origin HEAD` (NEVER do a bare push) before waiting for instructions or concluding a session.
5. Before concluding, update `.agent/HANDOFF.md` using the handoff template defined in `.agent/AGENTS.md`.
